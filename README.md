# Design Handoff Project

This week, we got a design from a UX design student. It is a landing page for a fitness club [’Gym”, “Yoga Studio”] and we build it in React.


### The Problem

I've had mostly problems with css, it takes a lot of time but I got it to work even dow I'm not done with the project. There's a lot more to style and code.
